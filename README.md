# Canbus-logger
GM MDI canbus logger

This is some code to log the data on the high speed canbus.. You would use this with an OBD2 splitter cable and an MDI(or possibly any J2534 device) and either another MDI or some other OBD2 device that talks to the vehicle.. You could monitor scan tool commands and programming data,etc.. 
Instructions for use are part of the program, it's a very simple command line program.. It's rough but it seems to work just fine..
