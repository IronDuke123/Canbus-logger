# Canbus-logger
GM MDI canbus logger

This is some code to log the data on the high speed canbus.. You would use this with an OBD2 splitter cable and an MDI(or possibly any J2534 device) and either another MDI or some other OBD2 device that talks to the vehicle.. You could monitor scan tool commands and programming data,etc.. 
Instructions for use are part of the program, it's a very simple command line program.. It's rough but it seems to work just fine..

I did use example code and dll from https://github.com/BrianHumlicek.
Hopefully I did include the correct copywrite information in the code and also here..
Let me know of any issues, I am new at this, might be able to fix it, but might not.. I will try.. 

I uploaded this version, some changes were made.
J2534 selection was added to allow for more devices to be used. Some feedback on what works and what doesn't would be great.
Costure Fody was installed to allow the dll to be incorporated into the final exe.
